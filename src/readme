Best practice:
0. __init__.py, this made this directory a importable module
1. server.py has all API's uri routing
2. each uri handle should be put into one single .py file
3. for common handy tool routine, put into util.py
4. for complex tool object, make its own class in .py file, e.g: dbwrapper.py
